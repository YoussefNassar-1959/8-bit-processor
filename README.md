# 🖥️ 8-bit Processor Project

This project showcases the development of an 8-bit processor using Logisim, integrating essential components such as an ALU, Control Unit, RAM, and Clock.

## Overview 🌟

This processor emulates the functionalities of a basic 8-bit computing system. It's designed to handle various arithmetic, logic, and memory operations while following the fundamental principles of computer architecture.

## Components 🧩

### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) 🧮

The ALU forms the computational heart of the processor. It executes arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction, alongside logic operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.

### Control Unit 🎛️

The Control Unit manages the flow of data between different components of the processor. It interprets instructions, orchestrates data movement, and ensures the proper execution of operations.

### Random Access Memory (RAM) 📝

The RAM serves as the primary memory for the processor, storing data that can be quickly read from or written to during operations.

### Clock ⏰

The Clock component generates and distributes clock signals, synchronizing the activities within the processor and ensuring proper timing for operations.
