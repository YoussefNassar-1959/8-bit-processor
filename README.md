# üöÄ 8-bit Processor

Welcome to my 8-bit processor project repository! This processor, built using Logisim, is a fully functional system incorporating an ALU, Control Unit, RAM, and Clock. 

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Handles arithmetic and logic operations for data processing.
- **Control Unit**: Manages and coordinates operations across the processor components.
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Stores and retrieves data during processing.
- **Clock**: Provides synchronization for the processor's operations.

## Overview üñ•Ô∏è

This 8-bit processor is designed to perform various computations and handle data using its ALU and memory modules. It operates based on a clock signal and follows specific instructions governed by the control unit.

## Components üß©

### ALU

The ALU performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logic (AND, OR, XOR) operations on data provided by the registers.

### Control Unit

Responsible for directing the flow of data between different components of the processor and ensuring proper execution of instructions.

### RAM

Provides storage for data that the processor can read from or write to during operations.

### Clock

Synchronizes the activities within the processor by providing regular timing signals.

## Usage üí°
